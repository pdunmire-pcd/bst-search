     * Returns whether a binary search tree contains a given value.

     * As a precondition, the input root is assumed to be the root of a binary
     * search tree; this is not validated by the method. Passing in an invalid
     * tree causes undefined behavior.
     * 
     * A null value for the root is considered to represent a valid but empty
     * binary search tree. A null root will cause this method to always return
     * false if a valid target is given.
     * 
     * This method must run in O(log(n)) if the tree is balanced, where n is the # of
     * nodes in the tree. In other words, this method should NOT search every node -
     * it should take advantage of the binary search tree properties to efficiently
     * search.
     * 
     * @param <T> The type of the values held in the nodes
     * @param root the root of the binary search tree (assumed to be valid)
     * @param target the value to search for
     * @return true if the target is contained in the tree, false otherwise
     * @throws NullPointerException if target is null
